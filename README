These two scripts setup and run re-reco jobs on lxbatch for HGC.

****** hgc-submit.sh does the job submission

* RELVAL_SOURCE specifies the location of the relval samples we're re-reconstructing

* RELVAL_LIST takes an array of dataset names. you can specify all datasets in the relval directory with
  >> RELVAL_LIST=(`/afs/cern.ch/project/eos/installation/0.3.4/bin/eos.select ls /store/relval/CMSSW_6_2_0_SLHC23/`)
  or just one dataset with
  >> RELVAL_LIST=(RelValQCDForPF_14TeV)

* GEO_PU specifies the geometry and pileup conditions (?) we're interested in. examples would be
  >> GEO_PU=PH2_1K_FB_V6_UPGHGCalV5-v1
  or
  >> GEO_PU=PU_PH2_1K_FB_V6_HGCalV5PU140-v1

* NEVT specifies the number of events to run over (used exactly as cmsDriver -n $NEVT)

* OUTPUT_EOS gives the target location on the CERN EOS space

* LOG_DIR is where the lxbatch LSFJOB (*.out) and STDERR (*.err) will be stored in the same directory structure as
  the relval source

****** hgc-run.sh is executed as the batch job
